## 🚀 SYNOPSIS

This repository is a playful twist on the classic "Hello, World!" program, designed to give beginner candidates a fun yet frustrating challenge.

Created during the piscine at 42, this project aims to break the ice, spark creativity, and encourage problem-solving in an unconventional way.

As experienced programmers, we know how nerve-wracking the first steps in coding can be, especially in C.

To help relax the tension and make the learning process more enjoyable, we developed with [@DyDaDo13](https://github.com/DyDaDo13) this quirky challenge.

It's not just about writing "Hello, World!" – it's about writing it in the worst way possible. Think convoluted logic, unnecessary complexity, and a touch of madness.
